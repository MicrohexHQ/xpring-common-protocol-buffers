# Xpring Common Protocol Buffers

The Xpring Common Protocol Buffers Library provides common rotocol buffer objects to all client side libraries in the XRP SDK. This library is built to be consumed as a submodule to other libraries, rather than a standalone library. 

Developers likely want to use a top level library for accessing the Xpring Platform:
- [XpringJS](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-js): A javascript interface for the Xpring Platform
- [XpringKit](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpringkit): A swift interface for the Xpring Platform
